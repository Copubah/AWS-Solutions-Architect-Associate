# EC2
- An AWS EC2(elastic compute cloud) is an AWS service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud,users rent virtual servers(instances) and run applications

## Key points
1. Instances:EC2 instances are virtual servers that can be provisioned with various configurations of CPU,memory,storage and networking capacity
2. Instance types:they can be optimized for different use cases like general-purpose computing,memory-intensive applications,compute-optimized workloads etc
3. Security groups:these are virtual firewalls for EC2 instances,controlling inbound and outbound traffic
4. Auto scaling:one can adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand
5. Load balancing:Elastic load balancing(ELB) is used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances which improves fault tolerance and scalability
